                <!-- <div class = "horizontalLine"> </div> &nbsp;-->
                <p>

                    C is a very general purpose coding language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972. Despite its old origin it is still highly used today for a variety of different
                    programming projects. So why learn C? While it is great for general use, there are a few major advantages to coding in C:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    &nbsp;
    
                    <li> Efficiency </li>
                    <li> Low level capabilities </li>
                    <li> Structured and easy to learn </li>
                    <li> High compatibility </li>
                        
                    &nbsp;
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Programs written in C are very efficient, C will not hold your hand when it comes to coding, you must be deliberate when it comes to coding.
                    Its low level capabilities are good, in that it is very close to the hardware and as such very easy to work directly with the hardware.
                    Once you get over the learning curve, the language can become very easy and quick to code in. And finally it has high compatibility with 
                    C programs being able to run well and as intended on most machines.

                    I think it best to begin learning by describing the general layout of a C program. In doing this you can understand what 
                    every line does as well as where and why those lines are placed within a program.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For starters, like most coding languages the program file will begin with <u><b>inclusion statements</b></u>. Essentially links to other libraries or collections of useful methods 
                    that we may want to use in our program. A good example is math.h in which would allow you to perform 
                    mathematical computations like square root or exponentiation (without having to write a method to complete this action yourself).
                    Links to libraries are something to the affect of "#include < name of library here >" although obviously within those triangular brackets the actual name of the library file is placed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next you may have <u><b>variable declarations</b></u> of types int, double, char, float, etc. Here are where global bariables are declared, something I will touch upon later, but Essentially
                    variables declared here(outside any method) can be accessed and changed from anywhere in the program. Variables are declared beginning with the data type followed by the name,
                    generally you should make variable names simple and semantic(meaning the name implies what its going to be used for). An example: "int counter;". Any line involving the declaration
                    or setting or changing of a variable needs to be followed by a semi colon (;), something that indicates the end of a line. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After these variable declarations you have the <u><b>main method</b></u>. The average main method is declared as "int main(){}" with code being placed between the curled brackets.
